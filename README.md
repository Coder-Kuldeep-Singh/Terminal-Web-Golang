    # Linux and Mac
    $ go build -o uuidgenerator uuid/uuid.go
    $ go build


    # Windows
    $ go build -o uuidgenerator.exe uuid/uuid.go
    $ go build


    Once the above has been done, we will then run both of them. That can be done by running the command below:

    ./uuidgenerator | ./foldername
